# Notes on the Elasticsearch Build

### researching/troubleshooting

Figure out why the copy isn't working. What's the "overwrite" switch? Do I need to "echo" the overwrite into/onto the command? Possibly.

LB - what/how does it know the IPs.

CNAME references in config or IP?

What's the config need to look like anyway with other clustered instances?

CREATE & LOGIN TO THE IMAGE AND TEST THE MOVE COMMAND FOR WHERE THE FILE IS STORED ON THE IMAGE.
